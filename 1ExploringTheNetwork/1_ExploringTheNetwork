Exploring the network

LANs, WANs and the Internet
  The network infraestructure contains three categoties of network components:
    - Devices
    - Media
    - Services
  Devices and media are hardware, not allways visible, like wifi, you cant see it
  The network devices that we are familiar with, are the end devices;
    - Computers
    - Network printers
    - VoIP phones
    - TelePresence endpoint
    - Security camaras
    - Mobile handheld devices
  All these End devices are interconnected by intermediary devices like
    - Network Access (switches and wirless acces points)
    - Internetworking (routers)
    - Security (firewalls)
  The processes running on the intermediary network devices perform these functions:
    - Regenerate and retransmit dara signals
    - Maintain information about what pathways exist through the network and internetwork
    - Notify other devices of errors and comunication failures
    - Direct data along alternate pathways when there is a link failure
    - Classify and direct messages according to Quality of service (QoS) priorities
    - Permit or deny the flow data, based on security settings
  The communication across network is carried on a medium thet is the chanel
  were the message travel, modern networks use three types of media:
    - Metallic wires within cables
      The data is encoded into electrical impulses that match especific patterns
    - Glass or plastic fibers (fiber optic cable)
      The data is transmited on pulse of light, within either infrared or visible
      light ranges
    - Wireless transmission
      Patterns of electromagnetic waves depict the various bit values
  We have to choose which media we want by these criteria:
    - The distance the media can successfully carry a signal
    - The environment in which the media is to be installed
    - The amount of data and speed at which it must be transmited
    - The cost of the media and the installation
  Network Interface Card --> A NIC, or LAN adapter, provides the physical
    connection to the network at the PC or other host device. The media connecting
    the PC to the networking device plugs directly into the NIC
  Physical Port --> A connector on a network device where the media is connected
    to an other network device
  Interface --> Specialized ports on an internetworking device that connect to
    individual networks
  There are 2 types of topology diagrams
    - Physical topology diagrams --> Identify the physical location of
      intermediary devices, configured ports, and cable installation.
    - Logical topology diagrams --> Identify devices, ports, and IP addressing scheme.
  Network infraestructure vary in terms of
    - Size of the area covered
    - Number of users connected
    - Number and type of services aviable
  Local Area Network (LAN) --> access to network in a small geographical area
    - Home, School, office building
    - Provided by a single person or company
  Wide Area Network (WAN) --> A network infrastructure that provides access to
    other networks over a wide geographical area.
    - This are tipically managed by service provider many (SP) or Internet Service Provider (ISP)
    - WANS intercoennect LANS across countries and continents
  Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) --> bigger than LAN and smaller than WAN, it is tipically
    operated by an organization.
  Wireless LAN (WLAN) --> the same as LAN but wireless
  Storage Area Network (SAN) --> A network infrastructure designed to support file
    servers and provide data storage, retrieval, and replication. It involves
    high-end servers, multiple disk arrays (called blocks), and Fibre Channel
    interconnection technology.
  There are some organizations that take care of the Internet mantein the structure
  and standarization
    - Internet Engeneering Task Force (IETF)
    - Intenret Corporation for Asigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
    - Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
  Intranet --> Is a small LAN for a bussines or organization so they can comunicate
    inside the organization.
  Extranet --> Is for people from outside of the company like suppliers, contractors
  Common conection options for a small office and home office:
    - Cable --> Tipically ofered by cable television service providers, with a special cable
      that separates the Internet signal from other signals
    - DSL --> Provides a hight bandwith, it recuires a special hight-speed modem
      that that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides
      an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.
      DSL runs over a telephone line, with the line split into three channels.
        * Used for voice telephone calls
        * A faster download channel
        * Upload
    - Cellular --> The signal can reach everybody who hace a celular signal
    - Satellite
    - Dial-up Telephone --> Thes is very cheep and slow
    - Fibre optic cable
  Corporate connection have different options
    - Dedicated Leased Line --> This is a dedicated connection from the service
      provider to the customer premise.
    - Metro Ethernet --> This is tipically aviable from a provider to the costumer
      over a dedicated copper or fiber (speeds of 10Mbps to 10Gbps)
    - DSL --> There are variouys formats a very popular chice is Symmetric Digital
      Subscriber Lines (SDSL)  which is similar to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber
      Line (ADSL), but provides the same upload and download speeds.
    - Satellite --> Satellite service can provide a connection when a wired solution
      is not available, but is slower

  En las redes es importante que tenga
    - Redundancia
    - Escalabilidad
  Medios
    - Cobre --> telefono(1par)POTS --> MODEM

Simbología de la red en simbologiaDeRed.jpg

Imagen internetDelTec.jpg
  Port Channel --> juntas varios cambles de internet y lso juntas para que sean un
      solo bundle
  Switch --> Existen 2 opciones, puedes tener 24 puertos + "x" UpLink ó
      48 puertos + "x" UpLink
  WLC --> Wireless Lan Controler, este es el cerebro del internet, revisa que tanta
      potencia le va a dar a un access point y en que canal vasn a transmitir,
      segun algoritmos que lo calculan
  Esta imagen representa el internet de cada piso, y en cada piso se repite
