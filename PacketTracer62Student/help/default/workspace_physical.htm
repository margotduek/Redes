<p class="MainHeading1">The Physical Workspace
<hr>
<p>The purpose of the Physical Workspace is to give a physical dimension to your logical network topology. It gives you a sense of scale and placement (how your network might look in a real environment).</p>
<p>The Physical Workspace is divided into four layers to reflect the physical scale of four environments: Intercity, City, Building, and Wiring Closet. The intercity is the largest environment. It can contain many cities. Each city can contain many buildings. Finally, each building can contain many wiring closets. The wiring closet provides a view that is different from the other three views. This is where you actually see the devices that were created in the Logical Workspace; positioned in networking racks and on tables. The three other layers provide thumbnail views of their layouts as the next level icons. This is the default arrangement in the Physical Workspace, but the devices in the wiring closet can be moved to any of the layers. When the devices are moved to another layer, they revert to the icons used in Logical Workspace, although those can be customized (covered under <strong>Customization</strong>) to any graphic you would like to use.</p>
<p>When you first enter the Physical Workspace, the default is the Intercity view (or "map").</p>

</p>
<p>By default, the intercity contains one city object called "Home City." You can click and drag the <strong>City</strong> icon to move it around in the intercity map. You can also simply click on the <strong>City</strong> icon to change focus to the map of that city.</p>

</p>
<p>The Home City also contains one default building object called "Corporate Office." This building, like the Home City object in Intercity view, can be moved anywhere around the city. Click on the <strong>Building</strong> icon to change focus to the  interior selected building. All buildings are limited to one floor. From the City view, you can also return to the Intercity environment by clicking on the <strong>Back</strong> button twice in the Physical Workspace Bar.</p>

</p>
<p>The Corporate Office contains one default wiring closet called "Main Wiring Closet." Click its icon to view its contents. You can also return to any of the previous environments (Intercity or City) by clicking the <strong>Back</strong> button in the Physical Workspace Bar.</p>
<p class="myPic">

</p>
<p>The "Main Wiring Closet" initially houses all the devices that were created in the Logical Workspace except for End Devices. It neatly arranges those devices onto racks and tables so you can see where your devices physically are. The wiring closet view also shows the connected  ports and the link light status of the devices in the wiring closet. If the device is clicked, its configuration window pops up just as it does in Logical Workspace. Learn how to move these devices around in the building or even the city in the "Moving Devices" section.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Creating Devices</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Physical Workspace consists of Intercity, City, and Buildings. Adding devices to the Physical Workspace is the same as in Logical View. The Network Component Box is used to select devices to be added. Devices added here will also be created in Logical View. The placement in Logical View is determined by drop/click position of the device added in Physical Workspace.</p>
<b>To Add Devices to the current Physical Workspace view</b>
<ul>
<li>Select a device from the Network Component Box</li>
<li>Drag (or click) the device to an empty area on the workspace</li>
<li>The device shows up on the current workspace</li>
</ul>

<b>To Add Devices Inside Cities, Buildings or Closets</b>
<ul>
<li>Select a device from the Network Component Box</li>
<li>Drag (or click) the device to a container (City, Building, Wiring Closet).</li>
<li>The device shows up inside the selected container.</li>
</ul>

<b>To Add Devices to Empty RackView</b>
<ul>
<li>Select a device from the Network Component Box.</li>
<li>Drag (or click) the device to an empty area on the RackView.</li>
<li>A Rack/Table is created and the device is placed inside the Rack/Table.</li>
</ul>

<b>To Add Devices to RackView's with Existing Tables or Racks</b>
<ul>
<li>Select a device from the Network Component Box.</li>
<li>Drag (or click) the device to an empty area.</li>
<li>Since no Rack/Table was selected, the device will be added to an existing Rack/Table if space allows, otherwise a new Rack/Table is created. If the maximum of three Rack/Tables per RackView are exhausted, a new Rack View is created to store the device.</li>
</ul>

<b>To Add Devices to a Specific Rack</b>
<ul>
<li>Select a device from the Network Component Box.</li>
<li>Drag (or click) the device to a specific area in the Rack.</li>
<li>The device shows up in the selected area in the Rack.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Creating New Locations</p>
<p>The Physical Workspace allows you to create new locations to expand your physical topology. In the Intercity environment, you can create cities with the <strong>New City</strong> button. You can place new buildings and closets directly onto the Intercity environment with the <strong>New Building</strong> and <strong>New Closet</strong> buttons. Similarly, you can create new buildings in the City environment and new closets in the Building environment. To keep things simple, you should create locations according to the established hierarchy.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Making Connections</p>
<p>Cabling devices in Physical View is similar to that of Logical View. </p>

<b>Auto Connection</b>
<ul>
<li>Select Auto Connect from the Network Component Box</li>
<li>Click on the first device</li>
<li>Click on the second device</li>
<li>A reasonable connection, if possible, is created between the two devices. Note that it is only possible to use Auto Connect on devices.</li>
</ul>

<b>Specific Connection Between Devices</b>
<ul>
<li>Select a Connection Type from the Network Component Box</li>
<li>Click on the first device</li>
<li>Select a Port</li>
<li>Click on the second device</li>
<li>Select a Port</li>
<li>A connection is created between the two devices</li>
</ul>

<b>Specific Connection Between a Device and a GeoView Container</b>
<ul>
<li>Select a Connection Type from the Network Component Box</li>
<li>Click on the first device</li>
<li>Select a Port</li>
<li>Click on the location container</li>
<li>Select sub locations until a Device is found</li>
<li>Select a Port</li>
<li>A connection is created between the two devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Modifying Connections</p>
<b>Plug and Unplug Connections in Physical Workspace</b>
<ul>
<li>Similar to Logical View, select one side of the cable by dragging the link light. Then select another device and port. It is also possible to select another location container, then device and port.</li>
</ul>

<b>Plug and Unplug Connections in RackView</b>
<ul>
<li>To plug and unplug connections, select a cable and drag it to another available port. As you mouseover ports, a tooltip will show the port name. Drop the cable into the port to recable. It is possible to attempt to plug cables into the originating device or wrong port to cable types, but appropriate error messages will show.</li>
<li>There may be dummy graphical ports on devices, these ports do not have an engine counterpart and cannot be plugged in. These ports are identified by the lack of tooltip on mouse over while dragging a loose connection.</li>
<li>It is not possible to remove a connection by unplugging.</li>
